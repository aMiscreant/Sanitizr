**Sanitizr** is a powerful Android utility app for cleaning metadata and timestamps from various file types including images, videos, documents, PDFs, archives, and ebooks.

> Your files, your privacy. Sanitizr helps you remove hidden data from files before sharing them.

---

## Features

- **Scan folders** like Downloads, Pictures, and Documents
- **Image metadata** removal (EXIF: GPS, camera info, etc.)
- **Video/audio stream sanitization** via FFmpeg (removes tags)
- **PDF metadata** stripping
- **Document metadata** cleanup (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- **Ebook sanitization** (EPUB .opf metadata)
- **Archive support**  
  - ZIP (.zip)  
  - TAR (.tar)  
  - GZ (.gz)  
  - BZ2 (.bz2)  
  - XZ (.xz)  
- Simple UI for selecting and sanitizing files in bulk

---

## How It Works

Sanitizr parses file types using known extensions and applies file-type-specific cleaning:

- **Images**: Clears EXIF tags using `ExifInterface`
- **PDFs**: Uses `OpenPDF` to remove PDF info
- **Office Docs**: `Apache POI` strips metadata
- **Videos/Audio**: Leverages `FFmpegKit` to drop metadata
- **EPUBs**: Parses and clears `<metadata>` from OPF
- **Archives**: Extract → sanitize → recompress using `Commons Compress`
